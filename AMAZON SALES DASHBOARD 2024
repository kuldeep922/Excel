✅Key Responsibilities:-

* Created pivot tables and dynamic charts to visualize metrics such as total sales, units sold, profit margins, and top-performing SKUs.
* Implemented slicers and drop-down filters for category, time period, and region to allow user-friendly interactivity.
* Automated data refresh using Power Query to streamline monthly updates.
* Applied conditional formatting to highlight critical KPIs such as sales growth, inventory shortages, and underperforming products.

Tools Used:-

✅ Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting, Data Validation)
